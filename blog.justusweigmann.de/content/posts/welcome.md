Welcome to my journey as a student and engineer, where I am exploring the possibilities of technology and its potential to shape a better future. As a student at Deutsche Telekom, I am gaining valuable knowledge and hands-on experience to help drive innovation in the field of Information and Communication Technology.

As a Bachelor of Engineering in Information and Communication Technology, I am proud to be a part of the team at Deutsche Telekom AG. Not only am I gaining valuable knowledge in my studies, but I am also able to apply it in real-world scenarios as a member of the Operations UC & Voice & Cisco team at Deutsche Telekom Gesch√§ftskunden GmbH. 

But my passion for technology and innovation doesn't stop there. Outside of work and studies, I am a member of the Finkwarder Speeldeel, a local choir group, where I get to express my creativity on stage. I also indulge in web design and photography/videography as personal projects.

As I continue on my journey, I am excited to collaborate with others to create technologies that will connect people and bring them closer together. Together, we can make the world a better place through the power of connections and advancements in Information and Communication Technology.
