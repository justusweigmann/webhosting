      <description>Hello and welcome to my journey as a student and engineer, where I will be exploring the limitless potential of technology and its ability to shape a better future. I am excited to share my knowledge, experiences, and projects with you all and I hope this blog will be a platform for collaboration and inspiration.
From my studies at Deutsche Telekom to my involvement in the Finkwarder Speeldeel choir group and personal projects in web design and photography/videography, I am constantly seeking new ways to grow and make a positive impact through technology.</description>
